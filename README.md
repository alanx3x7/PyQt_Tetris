PyQt Tetris is a single player tetris game implemented via PyQt5. Modeled after the now-defunct
Facebook Tetris, it allows the user to play a two-minute round of traditional tetris, where the
aim is to 'send' as many lines as possible in that time period.

Tetris is a tile-matching video game created in 1984, where the goal is for the user to control 
pieces called tetrominoes that automatically descend, and maneuver them to complete rows. The user is able to move the
tetrominoes left and right, and rotate them. The only thing they are not allowed to do is to move
the tetromino upwards. Once a row is completely filled by tetromino blocks, the row disappears, and
all rows above that row shift down.

There are many game modes that exist within Tetris. Some of the traditional game modes include: 
* Marathon: Compete for highest score as pieces descend faster and faster as more lines are cleared
* Sprint 40: Compete for the shortest amount of time needed to clear 40 lines
* Battle 2P: Compete in order to knockout an opponent by clearing lines to send lines to the opponent
* Time Trial: Compete for the most lines sent given a specific amount of time
